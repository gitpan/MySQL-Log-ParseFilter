MySQL-Log-ParseFilter v1.00
===========================

MySQL::Log::ParseFilter is a Perl module for parsing and filtering MySQL slow,
general, binary and msl patched logs. It also parses and filters user-defined
logs: logs with variable headers and SQL statement meta-properties.

filtering, allowing a script to simply extract the data that it wants.
