Installing MySQL-Log-ParseFilter requires only the usual steps:

   tar xvfz MySQL-Log-ParseFilter-<version>.tar.gz
   cd MySQL-Log-ParseFilter-<version>.tar.gz

   make install

To install everything to a directory other than the system default,
such as your home directory, chanage the 3rd step above to:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
